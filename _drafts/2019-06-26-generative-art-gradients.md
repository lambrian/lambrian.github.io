title: Textural Gradients / First Foray into Generative Art

If you've seen my previous posts on where I had been or what I had been
listening to, you might have noticed that I'm fascinated by the story
information can tell. I'm trying my hand at something similar but also very
different: generative art. Generative art is, by definition, art that is created
by a system that makes decisions separate from the creator.

With the infographics I have worked on, hard data serves as a fixed
input into a design format that I tweak to highlight aspects of the data.
Opposite to that, generative art I can set the rules for how the system
behaves, but the outcome is still random. Well, pseudo-random.

My first project has been working on textural gradients, where the gradient
is formed by the density of the texture, rather than color opacity.

This work is largely derivative of [Andrew
Heumann](https://www.instagram.com/beingheumann/).

I learned a lot about visualizing linear, polynomial, exponential, and
logarithmic functions. In this, if linear wasn't what I wanted, it was
polynomial. I thought I wanted something that decayed exponentially, but that
was too fast. Polynomial is the way to go.

Poly is the way to go. Happy Pride, everyone!
