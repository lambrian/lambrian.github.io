I built this little widget when the Chrome extension
[Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) became very
popular. I liked the idea of having a simple clock and message against a changing,
visually pleasing background every time I opened a new tab.

I wanted to pull from my own set of backgrounds, so I downloaded a set from
[Exposure.co](https://featured.exposure.co/) and had the extension randomly
select one to display. For the clock, in addition to the time and date, I
visualized the progress of the current quarter, half, and year as rings around
the clock.

The Chrome extension loaded the images from my Desktop; I have since removed
them from this online version for sake of file size. Take a look [here](/day-count/).
