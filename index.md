Hi, I'm Brian Lam. I am a software engineering manager at Figma, building features to
support design systems. I was previously at a company previously known as
Facebook,
building various parts of Instagram, Messenger, and Ads. Before that, I was a
student at Stanford University, where I received my Bachelor's Degree in
Computer Science.
