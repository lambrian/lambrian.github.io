Hi, I'm Brian Lam. I am a software engineer at Figma, building features to
support design systems. I was previously at a company now known as Meta,
building various parts of Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook Ads. Before that, I was a
student at Stanford University, where I received my Bachelor's Degree in
Computer Science.
