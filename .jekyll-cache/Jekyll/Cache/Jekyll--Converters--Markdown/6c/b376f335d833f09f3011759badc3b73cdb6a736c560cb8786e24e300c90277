I"o<p>There are many reasons to write, I hear. Most recently, I read <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/write-in-2016-938f569b535e">this
article</a>
by Julie Zhuo where she recalls her New Year’s resolution three years ago to
begin writing her blog. I thought I would attempt something similar.</p>

<p>She says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Write to learn how to write, and write to understand, the process itself like a
looking glass through which you may yet discover a strange new world… 
Above all, write to preserve the scrap of an age, a voice; write so you
won’t forget.”</p>
