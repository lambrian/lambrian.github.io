I"t<p>If you’ve seen my previous posts on where I had been or what I had been
listening to, you might have noticed that I’m fascinated by the story
information can tell. I’m trying my hand at something similar but also very
different: generative art. Generative art is, by definition, art that is created
by a system that makes decisions separate from the creator.</p>
